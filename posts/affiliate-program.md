## Some context

Back in late September, I [announced](https://mailchi.mp/c3d150bf0bc3/major-updates) my plans to start an affiliate program for One Word Domains, which will allow you to make some extra income by selling our products to interested users in your network. 

Much to my pleasant surprise, a lot of my users expressed interest in this idea, and that got me really excited. However, I was unable to find an affiliate management platform that best suited my needs – they either had a hefty setup fee that would cost me a couple thousand dollars right off the bat, or were bloated with features I didn't need, which would really hamper my site's load speed.

Therefore, I decided to build my own custom solution.

After nearly 2 months, 5,000 lines of code, and countless all-nighters later, I'm very excited (and a little nervous) to share with you that the official [One Word Domains Affiliate Program ](https://recurrence.app/advertisers/one-word-domains)is now live!

## Program Terms

Here's a quick rundown of the terms of the [program](https://recurrence.app/advertisers/one-word-domains):

- As an affiliate, you'll receive a **20% commission** for every sale you make. For instance, if one of your users purchased an *All-You-Can-Eat* annual plan for $228, you will receive $45.60.
- If the user renews their plan for the following year, you will receive another 20% of their renewal fee, and this goes on for the entire customer's lifetime.
- You can request a withdrawal for all confirmed earnings after a 7-day buffer period, with a minimum payout amount of $100.
- Payouts are done via PayPal or Venmo, but I'm planning to add support for Stripe & bank/ACH transfer in the future.

You will also receive full transparency as you're able to track every click and sale that your affiliate links are bringing in at real time on your dashboard (refer below).

## Signing Up To Be An Affiliate

Signing up to be an affiliate is rather simple – all you gotta do is read through the program terms [here](https://recurrence.app/advertisers/one-word-domains) and click the "Join The Program" button to sign up (refer below).

Upon signing up, you'll be redirected to your dashboard (as seen earlier), which, given that you're a new affiliate, should be void of any sales data.

Now, click on the "Settings" tab on the menu bar. There you'll find your affiliate link, which you can copy to your clipboard, paste it on your site, and start making affiliate sales!
