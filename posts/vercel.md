Very excited to announce that I will be joining the incredible team at ‚ñ≤[Vercel](https://vercel.com/) to help build the future of web development!

I've been an avid user of [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) for a while now and the opportunity to help other developers build cool things with this framework is like a dream come true!



## How It All Started

For me, accepting this offer was a no-brainer decision, but the path that led me to it was actually quite serendipitous.

Back in May, while working on [Elegance](/blog/elegance), I accepted [Guillermo Rauch](https://twitter.com/rauchg)'s (CEO of Vercel) invitation to work on a really exciting freelance project with Vercel ‚Äì the details of which are to be announced very soon.

Three weeks into the project, I received a term sheet for Elegance's pre-seed round.

I was overjoyed!

It's always been my dream to build my own startup, so I thought, "ok, I'll wrap up my project with Vercel and dive into Elegance full time!!" 



## Guillermo's Offer

However, last week, things took an unexpected turn.

I had a call with Guillermo, who suggested that I joined Vercel full-time instead and learn the following skills that would be invaluable when it comes to building a startup:

- **Hard skills** like infra engineering, DevRel, E2E testing, enterprise SaaS, etc.
- **Soft skills** like hiring & managing the best talent, negotiation techniques, etc.

I‚Äôll also get the the opportunity to work directly with Vercel‚Äôs clients, a lot of which are Fortune 500 cos, and that will let me understand what their needs are and help me build a much better B2B product in the future.

The amount of growth potential is immense, not to mention it‚Äôll be much easier it‚Äôll be for me to raise at a better valuation later because of the skills, connections, and reputation that I would‚Äôve built through this opportunity. This is really alluring for me at this stage of my career.



## Saying "Yes"

Essentially, he made me an offer I couldn't refuse.

Two days later, I signed the offer and it became official ‚Äì I'm now part of the Vercel family üòÉ
